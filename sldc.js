// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 

const analysisOfRequirements = "In this step we are to gather the requirements for the use case that will inform how the intended system should perform. It's essentially a feasability study to determine the art of the possible"

const design = "Engineers define how the software will function in its future state. A fully fleshed out plan should be created for the software by the end of this phase."

const implementation = "The software is actually developed at this phase. Not only is just the software covered but also any infrastructure needed for the software to run is also created."

const testingAndIntegration = "This phase should include an iterative process of testing code that is meant to run in production to try and reduce as many bugs as possible so when it hits production it will be stable"

const maintain = "An ongoing process where updates and/or upgrades are made to the exsiting system to enhance reliability and security."
